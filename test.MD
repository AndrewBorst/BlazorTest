# Buy or Build? 
    
    A common analysis when directing IT resources for a medium-sized business is whether to build your own solution (coded by outside consultants or internal developers) or purchase existing software.  

Here a couple of different scenarios:

* Customer Relationship Management (CRM): This software is standard across many different industries. The cost of a SaaS solution can be less than $1,000/month for 30 users. The application requirements are within a couple of deparments and the existing software provides everything that your Sales and/or Customer Service deparments may need. The implementation costs can be kept small and the vendor offerings provide excellent API capabilities to integrate data with other systems. 

    **Recommendation:** Buy the software and develop some in-house experience to configure the software and integrate data.  

* Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Buying and implementing an ERP is very expensive for a small to medium-sized business. Let's say the cost is $2 Million over 5 years and it meets the business requirements. The benefit could outweigh the cost but everything has to go right. There are probable risks of having to customize the application for unknowable requirements and poor user acceptance.    

    **Recommendation:** Break the ERP into smaller parts. Buy easy to implement software to provide functions where there are standardized processes (ie. Accounting). Develop a custom application to provide order tracking, plant resource utilization and scheduling. 

When I advocate for a custom solution, I have found reluctance at the executive level to accept that coding software is a good option. My view is quite different because I view developement as quick and cost-effective. We no longer write a lot of code to do small tasks, we use libraries that others provide to do large tasks with one line of code. To be able to provide this as a benefit, the IT team needs to stay current with their skills and make efficient use of their tools.
